            <h2>General gameplan</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>In neutral you should be looking out for dash attack and dash grab. They are his main combo
                        starters. He'll
                        be looking for those from 0-30% since it's the main window for getting his ladder combo early
                        on. He can
                        also get them from up airs on the plat as well but it depends on where he is positioned and how
                        many jumps
                        he has burned.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Same idea applies when you are at 70-90% except he is looking for dash attack into up B.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>You should try to play outside of his dash attack/dash grab burst range and not overextend in
                        neutral.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If he is multijumping, he’s generally looking for a landing nair combo starter. Up air/nair him
                        depending on
                        how close he is to you.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If MK gets a ladder to the side, you’re pretty much fucked.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Dtilt is a strong poke that can lead into a tech chase dsmash or fsmash at mid-late percents. DI
                        up to avoid
                        being put in a tech chase situation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Sometimes its okay to chuck out dsmash/usmash in neutral as a hard callout against his dash
                        attack/grab.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Same idea applies if he is multi jumping above you.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Getting laddered sucks but you want to mix up your SDI and DI as hard as you can. You can start
                        SDIng around
                        the third up air since it becomes stale and easier to get out of. You can also mash up B too to
                        get out and
                        kill him off the top if he is next to you or escape in a position to where he can't Up B himself
                        to kill
                        you.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Your main goal when it comes to escaping ladders is to not escape the ladder but to avoid the
                        finisher. The
                        up airs themselves don’t deal much percent but the finisher (depending on MK is positioned) have
                        enough
                        knockback to kill.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Outside of ladders, MK has formidable edgeguarding and ledgetrapping. MK will try to wall you
                        with bair/fair
                        if he is ledgetrapping.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>His edgeguarding is really strong offstage but he will try to cut off low recoveries with nair or
                        neutral B.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Don’t recover high otherwise he will up B snipe you. But, don’t be afraid to recover high. You
                        can up B away
                        early on to avoid getting punished and mix your recovery downwards.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Watch out for Fsmash at high percentages. It acts like our usmash and he’ll use it as a hard
                        callout if we
                        overextend.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>MK is really hard to edgeguard since he has multiple jumps and 4 different specials that all act
                        as recovery
                        options but up air cuts off high recoveries and forces him to recover low.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Always ban FD</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Try to take him to Town or Kalos. The higher ceilings work against his ladder combos and we have
                        more space
                        to move around in.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Time out MK if you have to. Although he has multi jumps and many mobile special moves, we move
                        faster in the
                        air.</p>
