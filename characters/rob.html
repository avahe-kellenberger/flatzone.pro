            <h2>Wincons</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>We thankfully have a few, but they all aren't exactly character wincons as they are just
                        extremely common player habits across R.O.B. mains.</p>
                    <p>I believe ROB does personally equally well in all states of disadvantage, but most will opt to go
                        around the ledge if possible. Try to cover them going high and burn fuel the best you can. He
                        does not get any until he touches the ground away and it takes a while to charge back.</p>
                    <p>We also have some neat 0tDs if you want to get fancy and grab gyro! Keeping gyro away from rob
                        can also be valid if you arent comfortable using zcatches. Toss it up to get it away. Never
                        offstage or at rob as itll disappear faster. It is important to learn how to catch gyro outside
                        of dash attack/ a tilt as thats what they want to punish you.</p>
                    <p>Some characters can jump aerial it or landing aerial or wavedash/landing airdodge to catch it.
                        Learn what works best for you!</p>
                    <p>For player habits there are four main ones. Nair, roll, shield, laser.</p>
                    <p>Nair: most ROBs will nair in the same spots, especially in disadvantage. It is normally close to
                        the corner which really helps us because parry dtilt becomes a good kill move.</p>
                    <p>Roll: whenever pressured (especially on shield) robs will roll quite a bit. In the corner this
                        includes roll in. Easy upsmash to cover it.</p>
                    <p>Shield: you can scare them into shielding and picking poor oos options or poking their shield for
                        free once they are too scared to swing (or its a true poke from fair). Nair is extremely good
                        with this pressure, especially spaced and cross up nair. Rob struggles to deal with this so itll
                        often force a reaction.</p>
                    <p>Laser: robs will often laser in similar spots, even with bucket. The most common are from ledge
                        and after gyro in neutral. Iirc strong kills at 0 and weak is in the mid %s</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Focus</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Mostly want to focus on the habits stated above + general projectile habits. Bair and bucket do
                        amazing jobs at handling gyro while nair can often stuff or whiff punish most of his aerial
                        buttons. Also see how he handles gyro. If he drops it a lot, expect dash attacks and stay out of
                        that range, esp near ledge. Some will mash zdrop nair. Just hold shield 99% wont gyrohawk you
                        and if they do you gotta try and stuff it. It is fairly telegraphed from how they set it up
                        above you.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Neutral</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>I honestly don't know how to describe this other than a bullet hell game where you have to rps
                        once you get in (thankfully nair is a really good rock to throw). They have up close gyro shot,
                        fair, nair, ftilt, dtilt, da, and ofc the normal shield and dash back. If you're getting tagged
                        by bair, you probably are jumping in a bit too much and getting preemptively called out. (Or
                        they are just mashing it to kill. This one makes it easier to stuff if close enough or parry
                        punish). But good movement and awareness mostly fixes bair from being an issue if you are
                        grounded. For the other options, different types of nair can win along with more specific
                        options like pivot ftilt vs dash back, our bair vs their fair/gyro etc etc. You have to see what
                        they want in this burst range because it often either lacks in disjoint or speed, both of which
                        can be taken advantage of.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Disadvantage</h2>

            <h3>Ledge</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Genuinely the worst place for gnw to be. Rob has a few things he can do here. All cover different
                        things.</p>
                    <p>Gyro at ledge: Well, if they roll in to toss gyro down, nair them before they can escape. This'll
                        often win the interaction for us. Otherwise take the hit and reset. Sometimes drop down up b can
                        work, but they can also just upair or bair you. Just be smart here. All other options are
                        covered by the rob or the gyro. IIrc you can drop down dj zcatch with tight timing. Just know it
                        can be punished and messing up ca be pretty bad.</p>
                    <p>Standing at roll: Tbh likely you can just jump and escape. Bair is pretty slow and fair won't do
                        much if you do get hit much of the time so its a fine risk. Most other options can get gyro'd or
                        upsmash'd on reaction. Mix up so you dont get preemptively bair'd but obv jump will do well.</p>
                    <p>Bair/Dair: Both of these hard call out stall from ledge and will often let him punish roll in for
                        free because you can just drift to roll after. Obviously, don't roll. Pick any other option as
                        the moves are about to start if possible to get away. Just dont drop down either because you get
                        no iframes.</p>
                    <p>Nair: Low key if they spam nair at ledge we can nair it back. Otherwise a well timed get up
                        attack or roll can be smart. Sometimes drop down up b too.</p>
                    <p>Shield: Dont swing on it. Oftentimes neutral get up will be grabbed as well. Roll can be fine if
                        not in range and jump is obviously fine as it is unreactable.</p>
                    <p>Side B: Get up attack ðŸ™‚ also drop down dj nair can win if done early. Roll if theyre closer to
                        ledge and heading offstage. Sometimes get up attack gets hit by the back part.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Juggles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Dair is somewhat inconsistent vs him, but occasionally necessary to get him away. Try to
                        disengage otherwise because you can die super early to rob upair. I usually try to get to a
                        platform if possible. Otherwise mix up drift and your jump well.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Off stage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Mix up up b timings to not get dair'd. Be wary of them throwing projectiles at you. Bucket is
                        your friend here. Idt most will jump off after you. If so you can normally box them off or up b
                        away.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Advantage</h2>

            <h3>Ledge</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Most will never go here. If they do watch for 4 options. Roll, drop down dj gyro, drop down dj
                        laser, and jump nair.</p>
                    <p>Chef often catches all of these, but if you want to not chef to bait them into going here, this
                        is what theyll often do. Sometimes maybe a neutral get up shield or dtilt. You can punish the
                        regrab or them going high from here if their drop downs get shielded or reflected/absorbed. You
                        can upsmash the roll and parry dtilt the nair.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Juggles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>They will all nair in the same spot in the corner to land at least once. Parry and punish it
                        please. They have some b reverse stuff and stalling with up b/aerials. Just wait and let them
                        burn gas until you are in a place to juggle. Now theyre getting juggled with less gas if sent
                        offstage. Expect a lot of nair though. Sometimes a bair if you let them that close. Please parry
                        the nairs.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Off stage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>I honestly try to cover high more than anything. Up bing right out of range with back turned is
                        OP if you need to up b to chase. Lets us bair if they try to go back down while we can drift to
                        ledge. If they keep going high its a free up air kill off the top. Making sure to FH offstage is
                        a big part to catching high. If he goes low you want to drift around his buttons and poke at him
                        with bair or up b if you can and not SD. Don't really have to KO outright, just burn fuel. That
                        is usually the main goal here, burn all of his fuel so he can't make it back.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Stages</h1>

            <h2>Pokemon Stadium 2</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Kalos but with a better plat layout and rob can kill off the top easier.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Battlefield</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Super hard for rob to land vs upair here and really restricts where they are going to nair and land
                    (or it's on a plat for upair to farm).</li>
                <li>Our combos also get that much more explosive. Pretty nice for us overall.</li>
                <li>Be smart about the robs landing on the center plat because that's what they'll want to recharge some
                    gas when they go high.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Small Battlefield</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Pretty neutral stage, not much to say honestly. It's usually where I end up at least once during the
                    set.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Destination</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If you can parry the nairs well this stage is pretty explosive.</li>
                <li>Both characters can struggle to land at times especially because rob can cover landings so much
                    better on this stage.</li>
                <li>We don't get the same level of combos though and neutral can be a bit more annoying.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Town and City</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Supposedly rob's best stage so take that as you will.</li>
                <li>I like it because it removes upair and up smash from killing as early and only really removes our
                    upsmash (just dsmash or ftilt the roll ins). That said, now our wincons become super deadly.</li>
                <li>Dtilt ftilt bair all kill much sooner.</li>
                <li>We can also sometimes cheese off the side plats of City(2 plats) if they try to land there.</li>
                <li>During Town (3 plats) they are restricted on where they land as well and will often nair in that
                    open space for a free parry dtilt. That said, side b and bair will nuke us here, so be prepared.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Smashville</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We can kinda smother rob on this stage, especially in advantage.</li>
                <li>Small stage makes it hard for him to run. Can go both ways, but it's a bit easier for us to escape
                    because of the size difference.</li>
                <li>He also goes offstage much more often which is nice. Limits where he can nair too for easy parries.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Hollow Bastion</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Larger SV. Not much else to say. Probably a bit better for rob than SV, but still fairly good for us
                    for similar reasons.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Kalos</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Lmao. Big stage so harder to get in and harder to kill. Also harder to get rob offstage which is
                    where we often get our kills.</li>
                <li>Nair is also harder to catch without a plat so you have to parry for sure.</li>
            </ul>
