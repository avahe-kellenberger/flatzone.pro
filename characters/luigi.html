            <ul>
                <li>Keep away from him to try to bait out grab</li>

            </ul>
            <h1>Disadvantage:</h1>
            <h2>Ledge</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Watch out for zair&gt;dair.</li>
                <li>will throw out active hit boxes to cover ledge options.</li>
                <li>Can't punish waiting effectivley except with zair.</li>
                <li>If dtilting or dash attacking ledge then drop down nair will work very well.</li>
                <li>Don't roll because of grabs, up b, dash attack, etc.</li>
                <li>Regular getup through zair then up b could work well.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Juggling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can keep you in the air with nair, upair, down b.</li>
                <li>Don't dair at high percents because of down b invincibility.</li>
                <li>Best to go offstage to recover.</li>
                <li>SDI and DI away to get out of combos.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Advantage</h1>
            <h2>Ledge</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bacon works very well against him.</li>
                <li>Dash attack works well to keep him offstage and 2 frame up b.</li>
                <li>Dair can spike him with a 2frame.</li>
                <li>Ledgetrump nair or dair.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Offstage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bair works very well. Beats out his side b, just watch out for misfires.</li>
                <li>Drag down nair and bair can get him low enough to force an option or to kill.</li>
                <li>Dair if you have a jump and are high enough if needed.</li>
                <li>If you misread an option go back to ledge to get jump back and go for more bairs.</li>
                <li>If he gets above you use up-b to get him further offstage.</li>
                <li>Nair and bair and dair to deal with low recoveries.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Juggling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bad disadvantage in the air. Abuse it with nair, upair, bair, up-b.</li>
                <li>Doesn't have many options aside from airdodging to get out of juggles.</li>
                <li>Catch landings with dash attack or bair.</li>
                <li>Airdodge is laggy and his best option so bait it out and nair it or bair it.</li>
                <li>Avoid getting too close because of down b. If he's fast falling then nair and if he's at a distance
                    then up air.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Misc.</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>They're going to mash down b out of hitstun. Frame 1 invinicibilty.</li>
                <li>Watch out for zair, fireball, grab mixups.</li>
                <li>Don't touch his shield at all.</li>
                <li>Grab is pretty slow so he can't punish OoS at a distance too well.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Stages:</h1>
            <h2>Battlefield</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Good for camping plats.</li>
                <li>Big blast zones.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Final Destination:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Always ban.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Town and City</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Always ban.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Smashville:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Good stage overall. Camp under the platform with chef when at an advantage.</li>
                <li>Good platform to camp at 0%.</li>
                <li>Platform makes it harder for him to land. Easier to punish up-b.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Pokemon Stadium 2:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Pretty neutral. Okay to start here but wouldn't go back. Big blast zones help him more than they
                    help me.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Yoshi's Story:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can be okay for both sides. Both die earlier.</li>
                <li>Avoid it in general though because of down b, nair, and upair killing earlier.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Lylat:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid heavily.</li>
                <li>Hard to break zone of aerials and grabs and zairs due to low platforms. Very hard to land and take
                    stage control.</li>
                <li>Can gimp him so he probably won't take you there but always keep in mind.</li>
                <li>Ledges close to blastzones. Somewhat low ceiling.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Kalos:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Platforms good for edgeguarding.</li>
                <li>Can dair if he's close to the stage while offstage.</li>
                <li>Higher ceiling so down b and up b won't kill as early.</li>
            </ul>
