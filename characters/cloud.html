            <h1>General gameplan and tips</h1>
            <p>Our best opening we have vs Cloud is when he's off stage.
                Try getting him off stage, then killing him with bair.
                If he's recovering low, we can dash attack 2 frame his up B almost always (even with limit up b).</p>
            <p>I'll opt for punishes that do less damage if they send at better angles. Especially dtilt. If you hit
                dtilt its prob ggs.</p>
            <p>Play grounded, he can swat us out of the air very easily with huge hitboxes without thinking</p>
            <p>Make use of dash -&gt; shield and walk -&gt; shield to mess up his spacing, to give us openings to use up
                b oos</p>
            <p>Parry his fair/bair, then dash attack or grab</p>
            <p>If he's constantly using falling aerials, we can open him up with a pre-emptive up b, or fh nair</p>

            <h1>Neutral</h1>
            <p>You mostly want to stay grounded not only because dealing with his aerials is annoying, but also cross
                slash farms most jump ins.</p>
            <p>You only want to really jump in with like bair a2a or to stuff a jump with nair up close. Sometimes for
                dash backs to like fh over ftilt. Otherwise grounded play is best.</p>
            <p>Grab is super good to call out shields as they're also looking to up b quite a bit.</p>

            <h1>Advantage</h1>
            <h2>Juggles</h2>
            <p>Tbh mostly watch for dair and ff nairdodge. Upair does a pretty good job at covering it from most places.
            </p>
            <p>Upair > upb at mid/high%s is pretty good at getting them offstage. Otherwise you may want to bair his
                dair whenever upair isn't cutting it. Positioning for this is key.</p>
            <h2>Ledge trapping</h2>
            <p>Chef at ledge is really good as it can force a jump from ledge. You can call out the jump with sh up air,
                which combos into up b, sending cloud back off stage.</p>
            <p>Cloud's up smash is huge, he can punish spaced landing bair on shield with up smash</p>
            <p>Cloud Neutral b can be absorbed by bucket, and bucket will kill at around 15%.</p>

            <h1>Disadvantage</h1>
            <h2>Corner</h2>
            <p>Turnaround shield in the corner can be pretty good as it allows is to bair oos moves like ftilt.</p>
            <h2>Offstage</h2>
            <p>Tbh just like mix up timings to not get dair'd. Being too hasty is asking to get swung on pretty badly.
            </p>
            <h2>Ledge</h2>
            <p>Cloud bair/ftilt can be a pretty scary, but timing mixups are key here. Idt get up attack is really an
                option, but timing mixups of neutral get up, roll, jump, and drop down dj options are key. I've also
                found success in neutral get up into run off dj bair. If they are just bairing, find the opening between
                them and pick your option. If he is just standing to ftilt, you can usually just jump.</p>
            <h2>Juggling</h2>
            <p>Rarely worth challenging him with dair. Try your best to get to ledge if possible or find a platform to
                get to. Good use of bucket jumping can help imo. Just make sure it's too far for dj upair to nuke you.
                Landing with bair can also be okay. Just obv be smart about it.</p>
            <h2>Getting out of the corner</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If we're being pressured in the corner, don't jump</li>
                <li>Walk -&gt; shield is really good here</li>
                <li>Getting grabbed by cloud never matters, so don't worry about that here</li>
                <li>You can also up b through his shit in the corner because of our iframes, then just have to deal with
                    landing</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Cloud up b counterplay</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Shield the rising hits, roll behind him, and charge down smash</li>
                <li>Shield the rising hits, spot dodge the falling hits, and down smash</li>
                <li>Shield rising hits, up b or up air him on the way down</li>
                <li>Shield rising hits, up smash him on the way down</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Cloud side b counterplay:</h1>
            <p>If Cloud does a full side b on our shield, it's -24. We have just enough time to drop shield -&gt; dsmash
            </p>
            <p>If Cloud starts side b on our shield, we can roll behind him after the 2nd hit</p>
            <p>Cloud's limit side B can be parried easily for a free down smash</p>
            <p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXROMJgX9J0" target="_blank">this video on how to spot
                    dodge cloud side b</a>, it's really free</p>
            <h1>Bread and Butter kill confirm percents</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Nair -&gt; Dtilt kills at 105% at ledge</li>
                <li>Nair -&gt; FTilt kills at 112% at ledge</li>
            </ul>


            <h1>Stages</h1>
            <h2>FD</h2>
            <p>Tbh I think it's fine if you're willing to whiff punish dair over upairing it through a platform. Both
                disadvantage states are worse. If you're not good at handling dair, ban this stage. It can snowball some
                either way on the stage because of its nature.</p>

            <h2>Kalos</h2>
            <p>Insta ban. He can recover off the wall 100 times better and its also a larger stage so he doesnt get sent
                off as often. It plays against our wincon in the mu.</p>

            <h2>Town &amp; City</h2>
            <p>High risk high reward. Thankfully cloud can't kill us off the top as easily, but bair and ftilt will nuke
                us. On the flip side, we can do the same and get some cheesy kills at times.</p>

            <h2>Smashville</h2>
            <p>Similar to TnC but we get them offstage even more often because of how small the stage is. Really good
                for us because of it.</p>

            <h2>Hollow Bastion</h2>
            <p>Pretty neutral stage. Has a plat to hide under for dair. Fairly normal size too so nothing too
                noteworthy. Pokemon Stadium 2 Prob worth banning this too. Big stage lower ceiling. He can nuke off the
                top pretty easily while it can be hard for us to send him offstage. Neutral isn't anything noteworthy,
                just a difference in advantage and disadvantage.</p>

            <h2>Small BattleField</h2>
            <p>Once again better PS2. Smaller side blastzones so we can get him offstage well enough. Pretty neutral
                stage. Likely where you will end up most of the time.</p>

            <h2>BattleField</h2>
            <p>Most clouds are comfortable on this stage and it does encourage them going high quite often. This does
                mean you can easily get jumps out of them to edgeguard them even earlier. This stage helps each
                character's disadvantage quite a bit though. Take that as you will. However, it does allow for safe
                juggles vs dair at least which can be nice.</p>
