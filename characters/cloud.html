            <h2>General gameplan and tips</h2>
            <p>Our best opening we have vs Cloud is when he's off stage.
                Try getting him off stage, then killing him with bair.
                If he's recovering low, we can dash attack 2 frame his up B almost always (even with limit up b).</p>
            <p>Play grounded, he can swat us out of the air very easily with huge hitboxes without thinking</p>
            <p>Make use of dash -&gt; shield and walk -&gt; shield to mess up his spacing, to give us openings to use up
                b oos</p>
            <p>Parry his fair/bair, then dash attack or grab</p>
            <p>If he's constantly using falling aerials, we can open him up with a pre-emptive up b, or fh nair</p>
            <h2>Getting out of the corner</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If we're being pressured in the corner, don't jump</li>
                <li>Walk -&gt; shield is really good here</li>
                <li>Getting grabbed by cloud never matters, so don't worry about that here</li>
                <li>You can also up b through his shit in the corner because of our iframes, then just have to deal with
                    landing</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Ledge trapping</h2>
            <p>Chef at ledge is really good as it can force a jump from ledge. You can call out the jump with sh up air,
                which combos into up b, sending cloud back off stage.</p>
            <p>Cloud's up smash is huge, he can punish spaced landing bair on shield with up smash</p>
            <p>Cloud Neutral b can be absorbed by bucket, and bucket will kill at around 15%.</p>
            <h2>Cloud up b counterplay</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Shield the rising hits, roll behind him, and charge down smash</li>
                <li>Shield the rising hits, spot dodge the falling hits, and down smash</li>
                <li>Shield rising hits, up b or up air him on the way down</li>
                <li>Shield rising hits, up smash him on the way down</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Cloud side b counterplay:</h2>
            <p>If Cloud does a full side b on our shield, it's -24. We have just enough time to drop shield -&gt; dsmash
            </p>
            <p>If Cloud starts side b on our shield, we can roll behind him after the 2nd hit</p>
            <p>Cloud's limit side B can be parried easily for a free down smash</p>
            <p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXROMJgX9J0" target="_blank">this video on how to spot
                    dodge cloud side b</a>, it's really free</p>
            <h2>Bread and Butter kill confirm percents</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Nair -&gt; Dtilt kills at 105% at ledge</li>
                <li>Nair -&gt; FTilt kills at 112% at ledge</li>
