            <h2>General gameplan</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Jigglypuff players like to play passive and campy this can be punished by fair spamming and up
                        air spamming if they try to go over you</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Jigglypuff can't really beat G&amp;W's disjoints, so you should abuse fair and bair as much as
                        possible</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A lot of Jigglypuff players like to use pound to approach to counter this. Make sure to keep your
                        distance from puff and don't just jump straight into puff.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Pound can be beaten by bair and fsmash. If you expect Puff to pound, dash back -&gt; fsmash is a
                        good minimal risk punish that can kill puff at 70%</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Pound also combo's into soft fair into rest, so avoiding getting hit by pound at 26-40% is top
                        priority Furthermore, pound -&gt; soft fair -&gt; rest can be avoided by di'ing away on the
                        pound</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Doing a random upsmash when a puff approaches is a good mixup, and can catch a stray puff aerial
                        G&amp;W is such a cheater character that it's almost impossible for a puff to punish you for
                        doing a random upsmash</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Dealing with puff offstage, dair loops, and recovering</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Jigglypuff is one of the few characters in the game where G&amp;W can struggle to edgeguard or
                        even ledgetrap.
                        If Jigglypuff recovers low, using dair off stage can be a good punish, or just waiting for her
                        to come to stage and ledgetrapping with chef can also be good</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If Jigglypuff recovers high, there's nothing G&amp;W can really do to stop her so just wait on
                        stage and harass her with up airs when she tries coming back down</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>You can escape jigglypuff dair loops by hard sdi'ing up</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Jigglypuff has a confirm of dair into rest, so make sure to switch up which way your sdi'ing up
                        as to not get hit by rest</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If a Jigglypuff misses rest, use a charged upsmash to kill at 50% or later</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Jigglypuff is also one of the few characters that can actually punish G&amp;W up b.
                        If she uses pound at ledge, it will 2 frame G&amp;W up b every time. To counter this, use bucket
                        to slow your fall to try and mix up when you're going to up b, so the puff will mess up the
                        timing</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Wincons</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Honestly you are likely going to kill puff off a raw hit. Hard to edgeguard or ledgetrap. You can
                        get a bit off a juggle, but her airspeed is broken so that can be hard as well. Thankfully she
                        is super light so a stray hit kills super early.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Focus</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>I focus on how/when they want to approach as we can shut them down fairly well if we are ready.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>How they want to recover from offstage. We don't have any easy or early kills, but we can call
                        them out for certain options.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>What they do OOS. Her oos is fairly poor so we can abuse this.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Neutral</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>I have found two different playstyles that work with varying success. Do whichever you think
                        suits you and the puff the best.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Style 1: Time out. I can and will treat the character like a luigi (because she is). This means
                        no remorse when sitting under a platform mashing chef. She has some options like nair to get
                        through it, but its inconsistent and usually takes so long we can shield. Otherwise she has to
                        dj and go above. This is where you start nairing. You want this option tbh. Her buttons are only
                        safe when drifting away, which she cant do if she wants to get through the chef.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Style 2: Way of the sword. Act like you are playing your average swordy with bair/nair/ smash
                        attacks (think of them as swordy tilts). Spacing is key. Puff cant really challenge well spaced
                        buttons amazingly. Just watch for her bair at high %s. It can beat nair and can oos bair. Higher
                        %s for us is a bit harder. Treat it like yoshi bair spam tbh.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Don't shield too much. Between super safe moves, easy dair shield poking, and side b nuking
                        shields, it just isnt worth sitting in shield all day. Use movement or bair/nair/chef as your
                        shield or just preemptive up b to get room. She struggles to handle up b well.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Be willing to let the smash attacks rip. I find fsmash low key to be the best as it catches the
                        angle puff wants to be in the best. I'll just send it in neutral sometimes to catch them running
                        in and it KOs puff pretty early. Its not extremely laggy either so as long as they don't call
                        you
                        out, you should be fine.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Disadvantage</h2>

            <h3>Ledge</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Do not roll in. I do not care if you are getting hard read for every other option. If you roll in
                        you
                        die at 30. Just be careful about nair and bair at ledge. I usually up b and go around as her
                        juggling is pretty poor. Drop down Nair can also beat the options along with well timed neutral
                        get
                        up, jump, and get up attack. Timing is key here if you don't just want to take the juggle route.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Off stage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>I honestly just always go high because puff struggles to get up there and juggle around our dair.
                        Just be smart about it. If you go low, be ready to tech the nair at ledge because it lingers
                        forever. If the puff chases you, either get away with dair or up b, or have bucket turn you
                        around
                        asap and fight off with bair or nair. Airdodge and jump can mean ggs, especially if poorly timed
                        so
                        its often better to pick the safer options here.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Juggling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>So long as you are smart about it, she can only really catch landings. Even then it can be hard
                        for
                        her to catch good landings such as drift away or bair/fair/nair. She cant chase high because
                        dair
                        will win or we both miss and gnw is below her. She will likely track our landings with
                        fair/bair/da.
                        Just be smart here. I don't recommend dair unless she chases you. The other options work much
                        better. Especially drift away if you can.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Combos</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Legit mash up b out of most. It'll save you more than it should. SDI dair up and away from
                        wherever
                        the puff wants you to go. I mash up b here and usually get out. Better than death at 30.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Advantage</h2>

            <h3>Ledge</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Never stand close to ledge. Asking to get hit by sing. Just chef and be ready for them to either
                        jump over or drop down dj airdodge to get through. Spaced fair can also be nice and help stop
                        their stuff occasionally.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Off stage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Chase with bair. I don't really care to up b because the reversal means death at any %. If you
                        need to go higher, get on a platform first or just wait for them to get lower and chase from
                        below. The airdodge goes super far, so if they take that route, just go back to stage and try to
                        cover that or ledgetrap. I've yet to have a footstool actually work vs puff, but feel free to
                        try. Bair and fair on side plats are the money makers here though. Be ready to chase hard for
                        earlier kills here.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Juggling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It is often pretty hard to juggle puff because of her airspeed. Thankfully she can't fall fast,
                        but you do have to be able to track well and be willing to commit to catch her landings for
                        stocks. I think using plats to continue advantage here is probably the best bet. It also unlocks
                        nair as a kill option a bit sooner.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Bread and Butter kill confirm percents</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Nair -&gt; Ftilt will kill puff at 88% at ledge.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Nair -&gt; Dtilt will kill puff at 80% at ledge (Note nair -&gt; Dtilt is very inconsistent
                        against short character's like puff).</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Stages</h2>
            <p>Honestly the only stage I know I hate versus puff is ps2. Normal reasons for it working against our
                gameplan and towards hers.</p>

            <h3>FD</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Rollout is the only notable thing puff gets here. No plats to land on either way. Pretty standard
                    idk
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Kalos</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Fairly good stage for us because rest doesn't kill as early and we have more room to get out of
                        juggles etc. Also easier kills off the side using the plats sometimes.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Town &amp; City</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Kalos but better honestly. We kill off the side much better. Just be ready for bair/nair.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Smashville</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Fine stage. Both characters die pretty early. Just expect as much. Easy to hide under the plat
                        too once we get it.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Hollow Bastion</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Just bigger smashville. Platform is a bit scarier for sing set ups, but I've been hit by like one
                        ever so I don't care.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Pokemon stadium 2</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Just ban this stage. Small platforms make sing deadly. We die off the top super early. Big side
                        blastzones so we cant kill as early. Camping is about all we got here.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Small BattleField</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>As always better PS2. Its pretty standard both ways.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>BattleField</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>I honestly go back and forth on this stage because I think if played well/right it is amazing for
                        us. More plats to run to in disadvantage. Better plat advantage vs puff when juggling. More
                        places to throw fair out to get the raw KO on puff. Decent camping etc. But if your advantage
                        just isn't having it, ban this stage. It can be super annoying catching puff going high on this
                        stage if you're not ready. Which means less damage etc etc. Just be ready if you go here.
                </li>
