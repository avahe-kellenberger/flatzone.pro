            <h2>General gameplan</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Jigglypuff players like to play passive and campy this can be punished by fair spamming and up
                        air spamming if they try to go over you</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Jigglypuff can’t really beat G&amp;W’s disjoints, so you should abuse fair and bair as much as
                        possible</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A lot of Jigglypuff players like to use pound to approach to counter this. Make sure to keep your
                        distance from puff and don’t just jump straight into puff.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Pound can be beaten by bair and fsmash. If you expect Puff to pound, dash back -&gt; fsmash is a
                        good minimal risk punish that can kill puff at 70%</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Pound also combo’s into soft fair into rest, so avoiding getting hit by pound at 26-40% is top
                        priority
                        Furthermore, pound -&gt; soft fair -&gt; rest can be avoided by di’ing away on the pound</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Doing a random upsmash when a puff approaches is a good mixup, and can catch a stray puff aerial
                        G&amp;W is such a cheater character that it’s almost impossible for a puff to punish you for
                        doing a random upsmash</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Dealing with puff offstage, dair loops, and recovering</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Jigglypuff is one of the few characters in the game where G&amp;W can struggle to edgeguard or
                        even ledgetrap.
                        If Jigglypuff recovers low, using dair off stage can be a good punish, or just waiting for her
                        to come to stage and ledgetrapping with chef can also be good</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If Jigglypuff recovers high, there’s nothing G&amp;W can really do to stop her so just wait on
                        stage and harass her with up airs when she tries coming back down</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>You can escape jigglypuff dair loops by hard sdi'ing up</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Jigglypuff has a confirm of dair into rest, so make sure to switch up which way your sdi'ing up
                        as to not get hit by rest</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If a Jigglypuff misses rest, use a charged upsmash to kill at 50% or later</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Jigglypuff is also one of the few characters that can actually punish G&amp;W up b.
                        If she uses pound at ledge, it will 2 frame G&amp;W up b every time. To counter this, use bucket
                        to slow your fall to try and mix up when you're going to up b, so the puff will mess up the
                        timing</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Bread and Butter kill confirm percents</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Nair -&gt; Ftilt will kill puff at 88% at ledge.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Nair -&gt; Dtilt will kill puff at 80% at ledge (Note nair -&gt; Dtilt is very inconsistent
                        against short character’s like puff).</p>
