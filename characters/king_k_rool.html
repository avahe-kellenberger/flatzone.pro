            <h1>Win Cons</h1>
            <p>Send him offstage/to ledge. These are by far his weakest areas and he should die offstage most of the
                time if you get the positioning. At ledge he can definitely struggle to get out, especially at higher
                percents.</p>

            <h1>Focus</h1>
            <p>Honestly the main things I watch are what they do after a projectile and disadvantage habits. A lot of
                them will do the same thing in both situations and just give up the game if you know the counter to it.
                They'll do something like fair/da/dash grab after blunderbuss. Something similar or try to jab to cheese
                you running in at him vs krown. In disadvantage expect nair and side b.</p>

            <h1>Neutral</h1>
            <p>You honestly want to play either on him or outside of dash attack burst range. If you are on him, he has
                pretty poor oos and if you play around his nair he doesnt really have much. Its good to note armor
                rarely covers behind him, so if you can get there, ggs. If you are out of range, you should be able to
                reflect his projectiles and catch any approaches pretty easily. </p>
            <p>Be careful of his armored moves in neutral. He mostly either has a move with armor or decent frame data.
                Nair is like the one exception, so be ready for that. It does lose to quite a few of our buttons tho
                lol. </p>
            <p>You can't really camp him bc krown and da kinda farm our projectiles. You just want to use movement and
                shielding some (not too much because getting grabbed is 20% minimum not including advantage state). Dash
                shield can be especially good to call out krown and get a grab from it for free. Just be aware on the
                timing or you'll get jab > krown> upsmash'd</p>

            <h1>Disadvantage</h1>

            <h2>Ledge</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If its the basic blunderbuss, just wait until he puts it away and then pick your option. Unless it
                    is pretty poorly spaced for a roll or jump from the ledge. Otherwise waiting is often the best
                    option.</li>
                <li>If they are doing fair, treat it like cloud bair but you can drop down nair from ledge sometimes if
                    you have the timing.</li>
                <li>If they are just waiting, I recommend jump with timing mixups because dash attack can catch every
                    option. A well timed drop from ledge can also work and let us reversal them if they get impatient
                    and da ledge stall (it will catch that as well). Just obv be ready for the jump call out eventually.
                    Part of why the timing mixup is so important is to stop this.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Juggling</h2>
            <p>If you use good drift and don't dair you should be fine. Dair will lose to upair 90% of the time and its
                just never worth. If you have to go offstage or to ledge. His only real tools are like grab fair da to
                catch landings more than juggle. Bair/fair/nair can do a decent job at stopping fair and grab. Empty
                land shield or airdodge vs da and you should get a pretty good punish.</p>

            <h2>Off stage</h2>
            <p>I can't really see a krool going for this over a two frame or ledge trap. Make sure to watch the Krool
                and
                mix up up b timings to not get dair 2 framed though.</p>

            <h1>Advantage</h1>

            <h2>Ledge</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Average big body at ledge moment. At lower %s he can try to wait out early chef's and try to side b
                    out of the corner. Just be ready for this with the normal krown counter play, or have a smash attack
                    ready for the start up because they'll all break armor too. Otherwise he really just has to jump and
                    pray, so be ready to catch the jump, or angle chef to. </li>
                <li>Oftentimes they will krown before they get to the ledge to stop the chef. Just shield this and start
                    after. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Juggling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Honestly if you just ban flat stages upair kinda folds krool in. Nair will get through one upair,
                    but have enough to get caught by a second. I mostly play this mu by juggling on the ground. Getting
                    on the plat can have its advantages, but at the same time you are at more of a risk of nair
                    reversal. Honestly up to you on that risk reward.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Off stage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If he has to up b diagonally, his stock should be gone or he should take like 60%. Get under him and
                    either up b or bair rinse repeat until he is gone. If he can ride the wall I will usually just chef
                    or try to get even lower to start this. He has like nair and side b to fight you off, but if he
                    whiffs the side b and you are close, you can just bair him for it. The armor will end and he can't
                    do anything else without sd'ing that low. If he is riding the wall and you couldnt get under him and
                    between him and stage, try to bair him into the stage and catch the tech. This should send him out
                    and let you start from a better angle.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Misc.</h1>

            <ul>
                <li>Just the belly has armor, so you can often hit him elsewhere to stop his moves. Fresh nair</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Stages</h1>

            <h2>FD</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Let's him nair much easier, but honestly not just awful if you are good about catching them nairing
                    in disadvantage. Scariest part is he can catch our landings much easier as well.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Kalos</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Probably should instantly ban this stage. We do have better options off ledge, but a big stage vs a
                    heavy character that we want to edgeguard and ledge trap probably just isn't smart imo. It doesn't
                    help he can ride the wall and not much we can do to get under him and between. Otherwise a lot like
                    fd.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Town &amp; City</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Not the worst, but you have to be fine with cheese or be cheesed. Bthrow at ledge will just nuke you
                    at absurd percents. Otherwise not too bad. We also kill off the side pretty easily and we can also
                    up b/bair him into the stage so he just runs into the bottom of the stage until death. Or away from
                    stage for earlier kills, either works. Just know what you are getting into if you are fine with this
                    stage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Smashville</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can be annoying to deal with krown and blunderbuss on this stage, but he also just gets one touched
                    usually. Small stage means he is offstage pretty quickly and into our win con. We can also send him
                    under the stage to eternally loop him like on Town, his advantage also gets a bit better, but not to
                    the degree as ours. He has a much harder time in neutral handling nair as well because there is no
                    stage for him to run.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Hallow Bastion</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Just larger smashville mostly. Cant to the loop under the stage, but it is much easier to deal with
                    krown/blunderbuss. Bit less risky overall while still giving us a nice platform layout and a still
                    smaller stage to run him over in advantage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Pokemon Stadium 2</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Kinda goes against our gameplan, but doesnt help him an extreme amount to instantly ban if you have
                    banning preferences elsewhere. He only has upsmash/upair/upthrow to really kill off the top, but its
                    about as likely to hit as our upsmash so we are mostly killing the same way. Only issue is it is a
                    bigger stage which means itll be harder to get him to ledge and push our wincon on him. That said,
                    he cannot ride the wall at all so we have that going for us.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Small Battlefield</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Better PS2 for us as always. We get him to ledge/offstage earlier than ps2 and edgeguarding is just
                    the normal strategy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Battlefield</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Really good for us. It gets extremely hard for krool to land on this stage because of the platforms
                    covering everything and cutting off any way to reversal his way down at normal %s. They can camp
                    under a plat, but it is about as well as the other stages. Our advantage is just extremely buffed
                    while theirs gets harder as we have more plats to mix up our landings on. They have to commit to
                    continuing their advantage here unlike us.</li>
            </ul>
