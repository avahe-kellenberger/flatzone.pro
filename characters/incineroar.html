            <h2>General gameplan and tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Play very grounded! Try to bait and punish. Only try bursting in with nair if bait and punish
                        isn't working out</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Throwing him off stage is better than going for a juggle, according to Maister. Get those bacons
                        in, or punish side b/up b if his mixups are more limited</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If he falls out of landing bair, just shield. He can spot dodge neutral b for an early kill if we
                        try to grab, like we usually do vs most other characters.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Never use fair in this matchup, UNLESS you're going for unblockable grab on shield. If he is
                        countering the bombs, we can shield the counter attack then grab.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Shield neutral b when he's at kill % and we have a healthy shield, shield 3 hits THEN spot dodge.
                        We have a lot of time to punish this move.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Incins land on stage with counter attack a lot. We can bait it out and get a huge punish, grab
                        combo, etc.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If he is counter attacking bacon, just keep hitting him with bacon until can get an opening to
                        grab or ftilt</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Punishing his landings</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Shield incin when he's landing after being juggled. Can punish any of his aerials with grab or up
                        b, if he counters we can wait and react, if he does side b we have enough time to react and up b
                        through it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>ALWAYS grab landing nair or fair on shield, it's just laggy enough to grab</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spaced bair can't be grabbed, just up b it</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Incins like to neutral b after whiffing attacks, be careful of this and punish</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Look for openings for grabs a lot</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>His nair/fair will go through 3-4 bacons, don't throw bacon when he's up high/recovering high</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Incin mains love jumping from ledge, so use nair or up air after throwing bacon if he snaps to
                        ledge without bacon hitting him</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Surviving</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>DI up if incin rising up b connects, we will always fall out</li>
                <li>Air dodge toward the stage if incin side b connects so you'll live longer</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Punishing his recovery</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ftilt incin recovery at ledge</li>
                <li>Always shield his aggressive up b's back onto stage</li>
                <li>We can up b through his up b to kill him off stage!</li>
                <li>If he's recovering low close to the stage, we can dair his up b recovery</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Getting off ledge</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If he is trying to dtilt at ledge, jumping over him from ledge is free</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Bread and Butter kill confirm percents</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>At ledge Nair -&gt; Dtilt kills at 112%</li>
                <li>At ledge Nair -&gt; Ftilt kills at 120%</li>
