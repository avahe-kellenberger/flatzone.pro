            <h1>Win Cons</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Diddy is kinda hard to find true wincons on, but I mostly look for monkey flip habits and try to
                        punish those the best I can. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>I push him offstage more often than not because monkeyflip is pretty hard to deal with
                        comparatively. If
                        we can get an edgeguard he is pretty fragile there. Especially if like chef clips him during up
                        b.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Focus</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>I personally loathe monkeyflip so I hyperfocus on this move. In neutral I try to stay at a reactable
                    distance to up b. In advantage I try to prepare for it etc etc. If you stay just a bit further away
                    you
                    can always up b it on reaction offline.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Neutral</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>So I <b>think</b> there are two ways to play this mu and do fine. I haven't gotten to play a
                        higher
                        level
                        diddy in a while, but I coached a friend vs one with the first play style and tried both vs the
                        best
                        one
                        around me. They seemed to work at that level at least. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Style 1: Grounded and shield heavy. Diddy mostly wants to rps you with like banana/monkey flip.
                        If
                        you
                        stay at a reactable distance to monkeyflip you can shield banana and preemptive up b monkey
                        flip.
                        They
                        also shield a lot trying to get you to hit their shield and get hit by banana oos, so grab is
                        super
                        good
                        here. Run up crouch can be as well...Just be ready for zdrop stuff. Same for bucket, but thats
                        more
                        of a
                        gimmick (albeit a funny one that'll work like once a set). Be extremely careful with other
                        buttons
                        and
                        also bad movement. It will get you tagged. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Style 2: Movement/aerial heavy. I'm pretty sure this is how its supposed to be played, or at
                        least a
                        good
                        mixture of the two from watching maister/miya play it. The important thing to note is the diddy
                        is a
                        lot
                        like us and wants us to hit his shield poorly so he can get started. This means we can catch
                        them
                        shielding with fair > grab and spaced/safe nair shield pressure. He can't really do much about
                        either
                        without preemptively pressing a button, which is what we want. If they start to do this we can
                        get
                        under
                        and nair etc etc. We need to use good movement to either get in with nair/fair or dash back/jump
                        against
                        monkey flip. We can also keep pushing by doing run up nair/fair if we think they will dash back.
                        They
                        will often go over whatever the diddy wants with the dash back.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Disadvantage</h1>

            <h2>Ledge</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Be careful of zdrop banana and ftilt. For banana at ledge Im pretty sure we have ways to pick it up
                    like drop down dj zcatch. But if anything else either go around or drop down dj up b around it. I
                    rarely go here I'll be honest.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Juggling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Just be kinda smart about it and don't panic. Dair beats his over extensions and loses to him
                    waiting. Empty land beats wait etc etc. Plats are great places to get to so he cant monkey flip or
                    banana it as easily. This will be mostly what they do. Be wary about shielding too long because of
                    monkeyflip. You can up b it usually again to reset both of you.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Off stage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>N/A Ive never had a diddy jump offstage after me</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Advantage</h1>

            <h2>Ledge</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure chef covers jump. Otherwise, be ready for banana, up b, or monkeyflip. Banana is super
                    hard to deal with if they have it in hand. You often have to respect it here if you cant call him
                    out and catch it. Monkey flip you can like dash back fsmash here if you want to go for it. Good chef
                    makes it a lot harder though so he has to jump and monkey flip over everything. Either try to upair
                    this or go for the landing with like fair on a plat or something to catch the ground.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Juggling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I honestly find this to be the hardest part. Treat it like flip kick and be ready to catch the
                    monkeyflip with upair. Also watch for b reverses and the like, but monkeyflip is the main one to get
                    them across stage. They often like to land on plats, so be ready to catch the landing here tbh. I
                    need to try getting on plats to bair the monkeyflip, definitely worth a try as it should work. Just
                    more risk of losing more stage on whiff.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Off stage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You have to get offstage asap or just stay onstage. Bair him asap to catch either monkeyflip or the
                    up b. If you get the monkey flip you will likely have to continue. The up b may be ggs, but continue
                    off to finish the job because it can be deceptive. If you cant get there, chef and try to aim for
                    the up b or the 2 frame if you can. This takes more stocks than it should. Sometimes they'll try to
                    go around the stage. Distanced chef makes this easy to stop because you can fh chef to the other
                    side and often make it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Misc.</h1>

            <ul>
                <li>If banana bounces on your shield, the next time it lands it forces trip. Get out asap.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Stages</h1>

            <p>I'll be honest I'm least knowledgeable here because Ive not played on all of them vs diddy in bracket :)
                I will write what I know</p>

            <h2>FD</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Idk</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Kalos</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Wall cling + big stage + flat stage means prob not good. I never go here though, so.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Town &amp; City</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Idk. I kinda want to try tho. I can see the camping being annoying, but we should kill sooner than
                    them on average here.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Smashville</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>They love to up b under the stage here. Make sure to be aware when using chef for them to switch up
                    sides. In general our advantage is much better here because they only really have the center plat to
                    land on and they get put offstage pretty easily. Neutral is also fine. Just have to be aware of
                    giving up stage because monkey flip becomes a problem. They cant dash back as easily so plan 2 works
                    much better in my opinion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Hallow Bastion</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Smashville 2. Harder for them to up b around.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Pokemon Stadium 2</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I go here more than I should. Normal PS2 issues vs a character that easily kills off the top. I
                    would try FD or TnC honestly if you also don't like this stage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Small Battlefield</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Better PS2. Not as big either so diddy cant run and you can take space from him and send him
                    offstage easily. Less room to monkeyflip away in disadvantage as well. Covering the closest plat
                    does us well.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Battlefield</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I think most diddy's ban this stage vs us. If not, it is fine. Both of our disadvantages become
                    pretty annoying to deal with. Be ready to catch landings on plats a lot. Push the combos as much as
                    you can. Diddy doesnt get the same damage difference on this stage as us.</li>
            </ul>
