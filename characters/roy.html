<p>Roy's fsmash on shield can be down tilted if we are close to him during the initial hit.</p>
<p>If the end of the hit (far) touches our shield, it has significantly more lag.
We can run up -&gt; dtilt for an early kill.</p>
<p>Dtilt will kill Roy at about 120% center stage when we have 50% rage (tested on PS2)</p>
