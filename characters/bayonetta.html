            <h1>Win Conditions</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Being able to keep a stock or percent lead helps out a ton. She has a hard time approaching and you
                    can play more defensively.</li>
                <li>Holding control of center stage helps tremendously since her kill power is reduced and she has to
                    commit if you're shielding.</li>
                <li>Capitalizing off of any combo starter but not overcommitting. She has a frame 1 air dodge and a
                    counter so be careful of combos that aren't true.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Focus</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Side B habits and mixups. If you have a good grasp on how she will approach you can punish most
                    attacks.
                </li>
                <li>Interactions with shield. She has no good kill throws aside from fthrow at high percents (and
                    usually works on ledge only)</li>
                <li>Approaches in general. A good read on them will let you rack up damage easily as well as kill. You
                    can upsmash grounded side b OoS to kill.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Neutral</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Shield a lot. When she rushes in its usually a grab. Spot dodge and smash attack or upb.</li>
                <li>Side B on shield can be upsmashed or upb'd. Grab at low percents.</li>
                <li>Dash attack crosses up. UpB works if close enough or just bair OoS if too far.</li>
                <li>Try to bait out smash attacks or side b.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Disadvantage</h1>
            <h2>Ledge</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Will probably go for smash attacks. Maybe bair to bait out rolls or jumps. Best to recover really
                    high if possible.</li>
                <li>Can't wait too long or I'll get down smashed or down tilted.</li>
                <li>Roll is the most punishable so don't roll too much.</li>
                <li>Well timed regular getups should lead to punishes when shielding afterwards. Careful of grabs
                    though.
                </li>
                <li>Dash attack crosses up on shield which is usually followed up by a side b towards the stage as a
                    mixup.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Juggling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't dair when shes on the ground or if at high percents. Go offstage or mix up landings.</li>
                <li>Directional air dodging is really bad.</li>
                <li>SDI down or down/away lets you get out of her combos pretty easily. Followups are limited though
                    dair will kill at high percents.</li>
                <li>SDI up may let you up B but you can die if she follows it.</li>
                <li>SDI aerial side b away? Needs more testing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Advantage</h1>
            <h2>Ledge</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to call out side b from ledge. Don't stand at ledge too much. Upsmash and nair are good attacks
                    to punish a whiffed side b.</li>
                <li>Chef works pretty well on ledge. Don't overuse or she will witch time it.</li>
                <li>She doesn't always snap to ledge so dsmash and ftilt can hit her easily with good timing. She can
                    punish a whiff with side b though.</li>
                <li>Look out for wall clings she can change her timings up. A dair can deter this.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Offstage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When offstage you can bair her pretty easily but it has to be spaced correctly so it won't trade
                    with side b. </li>
                <li>Dair is very useful. Beats out almost anything unless you misspace it when she up b's.</li>
                <li>She has a very good recovery in terms of distance so she can go pretty low or high too.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Juggling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Usually cant get more than a nair&gt;upair or nair&gt;nair or uair&gt;uair. Don't overcommit to a
                    juggle since she has a good air dodge.</li>
                <li>Mix up your juggling with empty hops. Chances are she'll throw out a witch time or an airdodge which
                    can lead to a heavier punish.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Misc.</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Upsmash OoS her side B</li>
                <li>Fsmash or Dsmash her smash attacks on shield. Especially when using guns after a smash attack. It
                    can reach when you're out of stun range.</li>
                <li>Nothing to bucket aside from charged bullets. Better than airdodging but don't miss if you're off
                    stage.
                    Bullets
                    aren't very useful on stage.</li>
                <li>The longer she is in the air using specials the more landing lag she has. Try to capitalize on this.
                </li>
                <li>First witch time is the strongest then it stales after each use until she dies. Length of it depends
                    on
                    how
                    well
                    it is timed.</li>
                <li>Dthrow 9 does't work since she has a frame 1 air dodge.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Stages</h1>
            <h2>Battlefield</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Combo extensions are invaluable on this stage.</li>
                <li>You can live longer and it's much harder for her to land.</li>
                <li>Stage control is much easier to keep on this stage.</li>
                <li>High blast zone so she can't kill you as early with a combo and more time to get out of it.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Final Destination</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Neutral stage. Neither character gets much.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Town and City</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Platform extensions do too much damage or kill</li>
                <li>Blastzones are close to ledge so I die earlier.</li>
                <li>I don't get much off platforms on this stage.</li>
                <li>Large stage makes it easier for her to camp.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Smashville</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Harder for her to side b</li>
                <li>Safe from dair under the platform.</li>
                <li>Harder for her to aerial when under the platform.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Pokemon Stadium 2</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Decent stage but it's large and gives her space to run.</li>
                <li>Ledges are close to blast zones so she kills earlier there.</li>
                <li>Stage control is key here as well though she can use the platforms for mixups.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Yoshi's Story</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Both characters benefit on this stage. Though you can kill her much earlier than she can kill you if
                    you
                    stay
                    grounded and hold center stage.</li>
                <li>Avoid platforms since they can get you killed if she combos you off them.</li>
                <li>Catch landings with up air or nair.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Lylat</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Side B is really good.</li>
                <li>Harder to land because of platforms.</li>
                <li>Harder to land with aerials overall.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Kalos</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You get to live very long and she has more distance to cover for her combos.</li>
                <li>She can camp you out since it's a large stage so try to keep a lead.</li>
                <li>Her kill options are all less effective.</li>
            </ul>
