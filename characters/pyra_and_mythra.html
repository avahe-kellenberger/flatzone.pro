            <h1>Win Conditions</h1>
            <p>The main goal of the MU is to gain stage control, hold your space, and edge guard Pythra, as while she
                has the stage it is very hard to contest her position, which means you need to play slow and cautious
            </p>
            <h1>Focus</h1>
            <p>Landing simple but effective reads in order to keep Pythra away from stage as much as possible, be it
                Juggling or ledge trapping</p>
            <h1>Neutral</h1>
            <p>While in neutral, Pythra always has advantage, with fast long normals that G&amp;W cannot up b OOS
                effectively, keep to the ground and approach with shield in order to mess up their spacing and gain an
                advantage, Pythra&#39;s main options are almost always going to outrange yours, so play a Punish game on
                her more committal options </p>
            <h1>Disadvantage</h1>
            <h2>Ledge</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Mythra has very fast options and can cover ground quickly, however is not the main threat at ledge
                    do to having low knockback and being focused more on combo tools, albeit that does not mean you can
                    take her ledge trapping for granted as it can rack up damage quickly if you aren&#39;t careful</li>
                <li>The main threat at around 60% is Pyra, with, in my opinion, the most annoying move in the toolkit, F
                    Tilt, covering space, coming out quickly, and being completely safe on shield when spaced, not to
                    mention that it sends at an awful angle and kills relatively early, instead of contesting Pyra at
                    ledge, I&#39;ve had much more success getting around her and to the other side of stage to reset to
                    neutral, which is easier to contest than Mythra</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Juggling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Mythra has much more success juggling than Pyra, as she can move quickly to your position and keep
                    you in the air for a long time, the best option usually being going to ledge to swap them to Pyra,
                    as her movement is slower enough to be reasonably contested on the reset to neutral, Pyra, like
                    Mythra for ledge trapping, should not be taken for granted while being juggled however, as a few
                    good up airs can get you killed at 70%</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Advantage</h1>
            <h2>Ledge</h2>
            <p>On ledge, Pythra has a pretty good get up attack that makes bacon need to be spaced properly, and Mythra
                can foresight through bacon ledge trapping, most other options are beat out by basic bacon routing
                however, making this the most basic part of advantage, be aware that Pyra will try to cheese an up b
                kill at ledge if you aren&#39;t careful</p>
            <h2>Offstage</h2>
            <p>Pythra has a bad recovery against G&amp;W offstage, with up b beat out by bair in most cases and Mythra
                side b getting beat out by G&amp;W up b, landing these hits can make securing an early kill very easy,
                and shift the tide of the battle to your favor</p>
            <h2>Juggling</h2>
            <p>Pyra has low drift and is much easier to juggle with up air, making Pyra the best to get into
                disadvantage, Mythra however can foresight up air pretty reliably, especially after getting hit by up b,
                making Juggling much harder to set up against Mythra, done correctly, the goal is to force them offstage
                then land an early kill with bair or up b</p>
            <h1>Misc.</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Mythra nair has a landing hitbox, the number of times I&#39;ve forgotten this when I think Mythra
                        didn&#39;t space the nair on my shield is staggering, be as patient with your up b&#39;s as
                        possible</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Unless Pythra is very close to your shield, there is no reason to up b, instead try and Punish
                        the second move they throw out on shield as that will more than likely be less safe, especially
                        when Pythra is on the approach</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Stages</h1>
            <p>Mythra prefers stages with combo potential and maneuverability, whereas Pyra prefers stages in which she
                can corner you easily with her large hitboxes, because of this, it is better to choose your counter
                picks based on preference of which one you feel you play better against</p>

                <li>Layout Dependant, tri-plat Mythra, ledge plats Pyra</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Smashville</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Perhaps the most even, as the large center plat provides good space for G&amp;W to move, without
                    making Mythra&#39;s combos to extensive</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Pokemon Stadium 2</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Similar to Smashville, but more Pyra favored as her large hitboxes can cover most, if not all, of
                    plat</li>
