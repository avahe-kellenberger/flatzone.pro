            <h1>Win Cons</h1>
            <p>Watch for the end of his DJ armor or break it with moves such as Up B, bair, fair, ftilt, da. If they
                start swinging to stop you, DJ armor ends and you can bait this out to punish hard and start the
                edgeguarding. Bair is really good at breaking egg and keeping yoshi away from stage. I've found it best
                to get under him from this point to avoid up b and easily flowchart him offstage. Up air > up b is also
                extremely good at forcing this offstage interaction once you catch the end of his armor.</p>
            <p>Catching landing is crucial. Yoshi is pretty floaty and has poor landing options so you can often take
                advantage of this by hard punishing his landing.</p>
            <p>Knowing when to drop the combo to chase the Double Jump is extremely important and allows us to push our
                advantage even harder. This is where you can convert to big damage off juggles and edgeguarding.</p>
            <p>Abusing our disjoints is another important factor. Yoshi doesn't have much to contest them, especially
                moves like bair dsmash and fsmash. Challenging yoshi (especially from the air) is important for taking
                stocks in neutral and often lead to rewards well worth the risk. This is especially true versus the
                fair/bair happy yoshis. Dash back fsmash OP</p>
            <p>When you have a lead, I find yoshi can struggle to get around chef camping. If he commits to getting
                around you can often punish his commitments pretty hard. This isn't necessary to win, but is good to
                know.</p>
            <h1>Focus</h1>
            <p>I try to mostly focus on landing and defensive habits. This includes options like fair, airdodges, DJ, b
                reverse egg lay, spotdodges, rolls, eager oos options, and down b.</p>

            <h1>Neutral</h1>
            <p>Movement, yoshi wants you stuck in shield so he can get neutral b. Movement also helps dealing with up b
                because you can often punish him for doing it in neutral at mid/close range. This is especially true
                because good yoshis will space their aerials to not be as easily punishable (fair and bair
                specifically). It is much easier to handle without shielding.</p>
            <p>Good grounded movement vs yoshi is key. It's pretty easy to outrange and handle their aerial approaches
                from the ground (along with smart bair/nair usage to stuff or outrange them). Being above yoshi is one
                if the worst things possible. You always want to be horizontal or below him. He isn't as scary there.
                Especially compared to gnw.</p>
            <p>Spaced shield pressure >>> safe shield pressure. Yoshi oos is extremely good, but similarly to ours it
                can be countered by good spacing. Space nair in particular is impossible for yoshi to punish and allows
                us to pressure him safely. You can often punish the bad nairs oos, especially in the corner where he
                cannot drift back as far.</p>
            <p>Grab oos is particularly bad vs yoshi. Just keep that in mind.</p>

            <h1>Disadvantage</h1>

            <h2>Ledge</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>His ledgetrapping isn't like too oppressive. Just make sure to mix up well. He can easily catch up b
                    from ledge, so be aware. I like empty jump or neutral get up, but it's all about the mixups.</li>
                <li>Be aware of dtilt/dsmash/fair to catch ledge hang, nair oos for the grounded get up options (and bad
                    up bs from ledge), and up b for similar use to ours. Some may use bair to catch ledge jump. For
                    bair/fair timing mixups are big. Just find the opening to pick an option and watch hanging on ledge
                    too long because of fair.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Juggling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Just get offstage/to ledge. Its genuinely not worth forcing anything here. As stated before, you
                    never want to be above yoshi. Don't panic though as he can blow you up for bad dairs, especially
                    offstage.</li>
                <li>You can try to challenge up air after they full commit, along with timing your airdodge here, but
                    avoid this if you can. He can armor dair and then hit you. Then you are just back in a worse
                    position.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Off stage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Just go around him the best you can. Be aware of how low he can go because if you can dair/airdodge
                    to get to this point, it is often worth. If he goes too low above 30% up b 1 can steal dj armor and
                    KO him...</li>
                <li>Mix up up b timings so that you don't get 2 framed, it's not super free but you can explode for
                    predictability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Advantage</h1>

            <h2>Ledge</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Lol. Mostly often won't play the game and just jump from ledge. Just go to juggling and catch the
                    double jump.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Juggling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>This is likely one of the hardest parts, yet done well we can steal stocks from Yoshi at any %. Once
                    the feet are done fluttering, the armor is over. This is where you can start unless they break the
                    armor by using a move/airdodge. Most will also try to use b reverse egglay to get away. If you call
                    this out it can be ggs for them.</li>
                <li>If they aren't at high%s to break armor, it's likely not worth sending them offstage unless you can
                    catch an airdodge or get them lower to the ground. Yoshi is super floaty so you can frame trap
                    airdodge for free and try to push them to ledge so once they are at mid/high % you can convert into
                    an edgeguard. Upair kinda beats all of his options, just be aware of his drift and potential b
                    reverses to a plat (it is likely worth getting onto a plat to force sooner reactions and punish
                    these options harder than simply fairing the platform to catch landing). Catching frame traps is
                    equally as good as edgeguards in the mu to secure stocks, so it is crucial to have down.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Off stage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>As stated above, its really not worth until a good move breaks armor. Just juggle. If they go to
                    ledge you can 2 frame with ftilt dsmash or dash attack. Theyll likely not make it back after
                    especially sour dsmash, but his airspeed is extremely good and his first 3 up bs give him good
                    height.</li>
                <li>Once moves break armor, feel free to meet him near the peak of his jump for extra security.
                    Especially bair. It just simplifies the process.</li>
                <li>When DJ Armor is finished, try to be under him the best you can. If you cant, bucket and bair vs up
                    b can be good options that albeit inconsistent can work. Otherwise you want to dj bair or up b into
                    him. His airdodge does go super far, but bair often catches this by just throwing another. Just be
                    ready. You can also try to bait and punish it that way. Once he has up b'd 3 times, he likely won't
                    make it back as he no longer gets any height until he touches the ground (grabbing ledge doesn't
                    count).</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Misc.</h1>

            <ul>
                <li>It's pretty easy to up b/upsmash/nair/spotdodge punish down b on shield. Just do it before the
                    second hit. Worth practicing timing. If you spotdodge, shield after and upsmash. Stars catch
                    sometimes. Better safe than sorry.</li>
                <li>You get iframes once you pop out of egglay. Iirc you get around 6-7 frames where you can press any
                    button still with iframes. Always mix this up for obv reasons.</li>
                <li>Armor break %s per move:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Up b 1: 28</li>
                        <li>Up b 2: 97</li>
                        <li>Ftilt E: 60</li>
                        <li>Ftilt L: 97</li>
                        <li>Bair: 78</li>
                        <li>Fair: 61</li>
                        <li>Nair: 81</li>
                        <li>Dsmash: 32 / 126</li>
                        <li>Upsmash: 37</li>
                        <li>Fsmash: 26</li>
                        <li>Dash attack: 56 / 85</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Stages</h1>

            <h2>FD</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Go here if youre confident in your advantage and disadvantage states. The risk and reward are both
                    much higher as it can be harder to land but it goes both ways. It's also much harder to camp, but
                    again goes both ways. Heavily advantages the better player if you want to snowball.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Kalos</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I ban this stage. Yoshi just lives forever and a raged up Yoshi is not good for us. You can cheese
                    stocks especially off the side plats, but for the most part it is fd if our advantage state got less
                    rewarding (but with a bit more cheese) so take that as you will.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Town &amp; City</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Probably not the best stage but it's alright. Similar to FD for portions of it but we kill sooner
                    off the sides (especially once we can break armor). Also harder for yoshi to kill off the top so
                    mostly just watch out for bair here.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Smashville</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I honestly hate this stage the most. Not a fan of b reverse egg lay off plat covering most of the
                    stage. Does share the same benefits as FD where both advantage states are super buffed, but I think
                    because it's so small and we have a number before we can break DJ armor, yoshi will often kill a bit
                    sooner than I like. So yoshi has a bit of an advantage there and has a better neutral on this stage.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Hallow Bastion</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Better Smashville for us. Smaller plat and bigger stage is kinda what we need to reduce yoshi's
                    benefits from smashville while keeping all of ours.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Pokemon Stadium 2</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ban. Lower ceiling wide blast zones. Unless you expect upsmash to work super well, the % difference
                    where the two characters kill on this stage can be disturbing. A stage thus big also can make it
                    hard to juggle him + send him offstage. I wincon camping on this stage if forced to go here, but
                    I'll ban it if I can.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Small Battlefield</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Better PS2. Closer side blastzones and smaller stage fixes most of our problems. Pretty neutral
                    stage all around.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Battlefield</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Honestly a lot like FD. Both or our advantage states become cracked, especially with good platform
                    usage. Unlike FD though, camping (especially under plats) becomes a lot better for both sides. We
                    both have some cheese center stage/on the top plat, so uh be aware of that :)</li>
            </ul>
