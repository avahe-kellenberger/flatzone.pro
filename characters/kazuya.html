            <h2>How to play neutral</h2>
            <h3>Do not Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Approaching is one of the main things you want to avoid vs kazuya since he can easily stuff out
                    approaches like dash attack, grab and nair with moves such as back tilt and ewgf.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Camp/Play patiently</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Kazuya can stuff out our approaches, but we can stuff out his approaches too</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Chef is really good at dealing with kazuya approaching, him reflecting the bacons will be useless
                        since it will just clank with the next bacon, cdc wouldn't work as there are times where it
                        isn't invincible, and since chef has 5 long lasting hitboxes it will hit him</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Fair and bair are also decent tools vs kazuya. Keep in mind to be careful with your chefs as
                        sometimes kazuya's will use neutral b to hit you, which goes through chef.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When close to kaz try to avoid shielding as much as possible since ewgf just ignores shield, in
                        general you just don't want to be near kaz, you have to play the MU similar to fighting Luigi at
                        0.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Advantage is HUGE for us</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Kazuya notoriously has a really bad disadvantage state and G&amp;W is very good at capitalizing off
                    it.</li>
                <li>Kazuya gets juggled insanely hard as he has very few options to get down, his only real options are
                    airdodge and down air, with down air being super easy to predict.</li>
                <li>You can also edgeguard kaz easily since his recovery is extremely linear, if he goes low aim to
                    stage spike him with bair.</li>
                <li>Kazuya also gets ledgetrapped pretty hard, he doesn't have too many answers to chef.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Disadvantage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>G&amp;W is one of the harder characters for kaz to combo but he still has true confirms, most of
                        the time you can try to sdi out or up b out of the combos, but it mainly comes down to the
                        kazuya dropping the combo or not.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If you're offstage you won't have to worry about getting edgeguarded, since it's risky to
                        edgeguard G&amp;W in the first place and kaz isn't that great at edgeguarding. Drop down nair is
                        risky as kaz has quite a few moves to combat it, ftilt, tombstone crusher, dragon uppercut to
                        name a few so try to not use it too much.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Most of the time just use the different getup options depending on what the kaz is doing, roll is
                        a bit risky due to auto turn around though.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What to do vs rage drive</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Against rage drive, avoid using chef as kaz can just armor right through it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Try to bait out the rage drive and punish with like a fair or ftilt, getting him offstage is also
                        a good decision as it can setup for an edgeguard kill or kaz just getting ledgetrapped.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>While ledgetrapping, try to be careful with chef since after the 5th bacon he can just do regular
                        getup into rage drive.
                        Fair is a good way to counter regular/getup attacks.</p>
