            <h2>General gameplan</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>In neutral, Bowser will try to fight you in neutral with patience, good positioning and using up
                        B oos as a zone bursting option. He will spend his time in neutral playing grounded bc he has
                        access to quick grounded buttons like jab and ftilt.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>He has very little ways to directly contest sh ff nair besides these options.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Bowser up B oos is a good zone disrupting tool and can be annoying if we mispace an aerial on his
                        shield. But, he is open for a huge punish afterwards. At low percents we can get dash grab, nair
                        or usmash as a combo starter and at higher percents we can get usmash/dsmash oos.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Bowser's disadvantage is horrible. Harass him as hard as you can with up air and try to push him
                        to the corner for a ledgetrap/edgeguard.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Be weary of Bowser dair if you are at high percents, but this option loses to our up air.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Ledgetrap Bowser <em>outside</em> of roll distance. His getup attack is huge, and can catch
                        poorly spaced chef setups.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>You can bait him to getup attack by purposefully doing mispaced chef into dtilt oos. But, look
                        out for dropdown side B.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Most bowsers will be looking for ledgejump nair into bair kill confirm as their escape option.
                        Catch their jumps with nair or up air and keep the pressure going.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When bowser is offstage, he has decent mixups if he has his double jump. Use up B as an
                        edgeguarding option to push him offstage if you have to.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Disadvantage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Disadvantage vs Bowser is tough, because of his ground speed. Retreat to the corner and avoid
                        landing on spots where he can catch your landing with utilt or usmash.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>He can use flame breath to catch your landings, but this works if he knows you like to land
                        aggressively!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Getting off ledge vs Bowser is tough because he can react to every option besides jump with up B
                        oos. Getting off the ledge with jump is your best option, then you slowly mix in other escape
                        options.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When recovering, please do not overshoot up B as a recovery. He will punish you on the way down
                        with usmash, utilt or up air.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When you are at KO percents, look out for Bowser side B. He will catch you with this when he
                        knows you are scared and become shield heavy.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
